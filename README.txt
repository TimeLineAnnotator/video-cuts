# USAGE
```
from process_file import process_local_file

filename = 'beethoven-op2-no1'
process_local_file(filename)
```

This runs the cut detection algorithm and creates a folder named `filename` with:
- `hierarchies.csv`: a CSV for importing a hierarchy timeline for the video cuts
- `labels.csv`: placeholders for the instrument names
- Images of the first frame of each cut, named `Scene-<scene_num>-01.jpg`
- `Scenes.csv`: the original file generated by `pyscenedetect`

The "label" column of `labels.csv` must now be filled with the instrument most proeminent in each of the corresponding frame images. See the example for the abbreviations used.

Then, go to the directory of the piece:
```
cd <filename>
```

And create a new hierarchy timeline csv with the entered labels by running:
```
python insert_labels_into_hierarchies.py

```
