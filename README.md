# USAGE
```
python -m process_file
```
On file name request, input file name of the video file. 
The video file to be processed must be in same directory from which the script is being run. The code above runs the cut detection algorithm and creates a folder named `filename` with:
- `hierarchies.csv`: a CSV for importing a hierarchy timeline for the video cuts
- `labels.csv`: placeholders for the instrument names
- Images of the first frame of each cut, named `Scene-<scene_num>-01.jpg`
- `Scenes.csv`: the original file generated by `pyscenedetect`

The "label" column of `labels.csv` must now be filled with the instrument most prominent in each of the corresponding frame images. See the example for the abbreviations used.

Finally, continue with merging hierarchies and labels by inputting `Y` to produce `hierarchies_with_instruments.csv`
